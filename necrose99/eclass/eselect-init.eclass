# Assumption: the "init" variable of /sbin/init can be changed
# via ${ESELECT_INIT_EXEC_NAME}. If unset, the default value is "init".
# This documentation assumes that ${ESELECT_INIT_EXEC_NAME}="init".
#
# Wrapping a /sbin/init is tricky. Firstly, we want to minimize the
# amount of wrapper code required at runtime, because less code means
# less bugs and failures.
# This eclass supports wrapping more than just /sbin/init, but for now
# this is all it offers.
#
# Below is the explanation of how eselect-init compatible init systems
# work:
#
# /sbin/init is managed by the eselect-init module and consists of a
# symlink.
# The symlink /sbin/init points to is the wrapper script for the given
# selected init implementation. For instance, if the system is configured
# to use systemd, /sbin/init will point to /sbin/init.d/systemd/init.
# eselect-init compatible init systems shall install their wrapper scripts
# into /sbin/init.d/<init impl>/ and their wrapped executables into
# /sbin/init.d/<init impl>/final/.
# At first, this may sound a bit odd (the double symlink level) but is
# for a reason: the init wrapper script is just one simple piece of code,
# /sbin/init.d/exec.sh, which gets symlinked into
# /sbin/init.d/<init impl>/init. exec.sh will detect what is the currently
# running init system and the implementation for which it's been called for
# in a simple way: it resolves itself (${0}) using /usr/bin/readlink.
# The currently running init system is the one /sbin/init points to unless
# /run/.eselect-init.run exists. This /run trick is used to redirect calls
# to /sbin/init to the currently running init system (so that you can reboot
# your system reliably).
# Have a look at the example below:
#
# Scenario: the system is configured to boot systemd.
# /sbin/init points to /sbin/init.d/systemd/init.
#
# When /sbin/init is called, the following happens:
# 1. /sbin/init points to /sbin/init.d/systemd/init and the shell
#    interpreter gets there (naive explanation, just don't mind).
# 2. /sbin/init.d/systemd/init points to /sbin/init.d/exec.sh, which
#    is a regular executable file.
# 3. /sbin/init.d/exec.sh gets executed.
# 4. /sbin/init.d/exec.sh determines the caller implementation by
#    resolving the itself (${0} is /sbin/init !) to /sbin/init.d/systemd/init.
# 5. /sbin/init.d/exec.sh determines if /run/.eselect-init.run exists, which
#    is expected to contain the currently running init implementation
#    (/sbin/init.d/systemd).
# 6. if /run/.eselect-init.run does not exist, /sbin/init.d/exec.sh executes
#    /sbin/init.d/systemd/final/init directly using exec <path> "${@}".
# 7. if /run/.eselect-init.run does exist, /sbin/init.d/exec.sh rewrites
#    the path to the final init executable and executes it: exec <new path> "${@}".
