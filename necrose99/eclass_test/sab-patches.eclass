# @BLURB: eclass that makes it easier to apply patches from multiple packages
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Adds a patch or patches to SRC_URI and makes it easy to apply them,
# with the intention to make the task easier for Sabayon split ebuilds.
# (Plain patches kept in a VCS are very nice, but in the case of split
# ebuilds, duplicating the patches is not effective.)
# The eclass does not define any phase function.

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: SAB_PATCHES_SRC
# @DEFAULT_UNSET
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Array that contains URIs of patches to be added to SRC_URI. Mandatory!

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: SAB_PATCHES_SKIP
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Array that contains patterns of patch names to be skipped.
# It does not need to be a global variable.

# Applies patches specified using SAB_PATCHES_SRC, skipping patches
# with names matched in SAB_PATCHES_SKIP.
# Two possible cases are supported.
# 1. A patch path which is a tarball (assumed file name: *.tar*).
# Such a tarball must unpack to ${WORKDIR}/<tarball name without *.tar*>
# and must contain a file 'order,' which is used to determine order
# of patches to apply.
# 2. A patch which is not a tarball, which will be simply applied (if
# it is not skipped).
